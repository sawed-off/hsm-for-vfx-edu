# hsm-for-vfx-edu

The goal is to provide some automation so that any school can follow these steps to start using the Hyperspace Madness project data together with a starter Shotgun project that leverages that data.

See https://area.autodesk.com/hyperspacemadness/ for more information about the Hypersapce Madness project, license, etc.

See https://shotgunsoftware.com/ for more information about Shotgun Software.

See http://developer.shotgunsoftware.com/rest-api/ about how to access and use the REST API.

[get_data.sh](/get_data.sh)  is the log of manual commands as per the header in that file.

[Shotgun...json](/Shotgun-REST-API-v1-for-HSM.postman_collection.json) is exported from Postman as I am trying to use the REST API for this exercise to learn it.
