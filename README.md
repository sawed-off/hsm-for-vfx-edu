The goal is to provide some automation so that any school can follow these steps to start using the Hyperspace Madness project data together with a starter Shotgun project that leverages that data.

See https://area.autodesk.com/hyperspacemadness/ for more information about the Hypersapce Madness project, license, etc.

See https://shotgunsoftware.com/ for more information about Shotgun Software.

Work-in-progess - thanks!
